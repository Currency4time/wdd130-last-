      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this website is to act as an advertisement for the Riverworn Book Club. Anyone who is feeling bored and wants to geek out with a good group of friends can come here to find the dates, times, and locations that the group will be meeting in.

 The first page is dedicated to flyer stuff. The who and what we are and why we think our club is worth your time. We are in town, we are available, and we have a wide variety of non-fiction and historical fiction books for perusal of anyone who enters with a bold opinion. Book lovers, cat lovers, plant lovers come one come all into our tiny little club, there’s room enough still. Don’t live in Riverworn but got recommended this website anyways? We have recently started hosting online sessions over zoom and will include details on how to join that on the website.

      <h3>Schedule</h3>
      <p>
        The second page is our more specific schedule, where and when we will be meeting, as well as what book is on the menu. In a meeting we all hold votes for the book of next week. It’s alright if you skip a session or two, no one will blame you for being busy. Is there a book that no one else has ever heard of before? Is there one you are trying to write and are looking for critiques? Stop and drop in our little library corner and we’ll be quick to sort you out.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        The third and final page is mostly just personal history about the website, and its creators. It is also the history of the club, what books have been discussed in the past, and what people’s verdicts on them have been so far. Story of our own events and our contributions to this little town. Our humble beginnings, our friendly neighborhood achievements… and even a few of our biggest blunders and hot takes. As we reach out into wild world of the internet. Be kind to use newcomers.
